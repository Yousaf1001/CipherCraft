## CipherCraft (React.js)

### Overview

This project is a frontend web application built with React.js that implements encryption and decryption algorithms using RC4 and Simplified Data Encryption Standard (SDES). The website provides a user-friendly interface for secure data transmission, allowing users to encrypt and decrypt messages with ease.

### Features

- **Encryption Algorithms**: Implements RC4 and SDES encryption algorithms for secure message encryption.
- **Decryption**: Allows users to decrypt messages encrypted using the provided algorithms.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: A simple and intuitive web interface built with React.js to facilitate easy encryption and decryption of messages.
- **Secure Data Transmission**: Ensures secure handling of data by enabling encryption before sending and decryption upon receiving.

### Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: React.js, HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Encryption Algorithms**: RC4, SDES implemented in JavaScript

### Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Yousaf1001/CipherCraft
   ```
2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**:
   ```bash
   cd secure-message-transmission-react
   ```
3. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

   ```
5. **Open in Browser**:
   - Visit `http://localhost:3000` to use the application.

### Usage

1. **Encrypt a Message**:
   - Enter the message you want to encrypt.
   - Select the encryption algorithm (RC4 or SDES).
   - Click the "Encrypt" button to get the encrypted message.

2. **Decrypt a Message**:
   - Enter the encrypted message.
   - Select the decryption algorithm (RC4 or SDES).
   - Click the "Decrypt" button to get the original message.
